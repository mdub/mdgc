I'm Simon, married with two teenage sons and living in Caulfield. I've always loved the outdoors and playing and watching sport, with golf (the ball-variety) and volleyball my main pursuits in earlier years, more recently distance running, including five marathons. Plus, I love my Richmond Tigers!

I discovered the Disc Golf courses at Dinner Plain and Bald Hill (my closest) in early 2020, both by chance. Loaner discs and then an overnight delivery of a Starter Disc Pack from Amazon had me on my way and I've never looked back. I love describing the sport to newbies, bystanders and friends who wonder what it's all about. Having worked for many years in risk management and occupational health and safety I'm keen to bring some of this experience to the MDGC as our club continues its strong growth.
