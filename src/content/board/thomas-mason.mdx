Whilst studying, I was approached by a friend working for QBE Insurance who put my name forward as they needed people with Accounting backgrounds for assessing builder balance sheet risk. My time at QBE gave me my introduction to risk analysis which ultimately became an interest that has now run for over a decade.

I have several hobbies outside of work including basketball, music and golf. I was introduced to Disc Golf via YouTube just prior to COVID. My passion for golf far exceeded my ability and I enjoyed several content creators who played a high level before stumbling over a former Ultimate player and Frisbee trick shot artist who had a golfing channel.

His transition into Disc Golf fascinated me as I had no previous knowledge of the sport and COVID created a situation whereby I went down a rabbit hole of content. I ultimately bought my first 3 discs (Undertaker, Challenger and Zone), joined MDGC and got to compete in my first social day in March 2021. My passion for the sport has now surpassed most of my other hobbies given its ease of access, enjoyment and the community it has created.
