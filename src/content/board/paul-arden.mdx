I am serving as Advisor to the Melbourne Disc Golf Club board and currently also serve as Director of Competitions for Australian Disc Golf (ADG) and Country Coordinator for the PDGA. I am a Computer Graphics Software Engineer by trade.

I was a founding member of both ADG and MDGC and have been playing Disc Golf since around 2004. I've been fortunate to be able to play extensively in Europe, Japan, and the USA (and of course Australia), including participating in five PDGA Worlds events. Disc Golf was popular during the 80s in Australia however by the time I discovered the sport it's footprint here had shrunk significantly with only a handful of players. This meant that back then if you wanted anything to happen you had to organise it yourself. As a result, I spent many of my starting years in Disc Golf running tournaments and helping develop some of the organisational structures that are still in place today.
