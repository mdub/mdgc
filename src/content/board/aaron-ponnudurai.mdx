Like many, I first played disc golf in between COVID lockdowns. Having always loved throwing discs and other things, I quickly caught the bug and started buying excessively fast discs.

Living in Spotswood with my wife and our dog, Riggins, you'll often find me at Stony Creek.

I look forward to contributing to the club and raising the profile of our great sport across Melbourne.

I'm also a celebrated and widely photographed caddy.
