Home is Warn Marin (Western Port Bay) side of the Mornington Peninsula on the lands of the BoonWurrung people. Have a tiny house with a large indigenous garden and 3 rescue Whippets, a beautiful 6km beach where we walk, swim and play.

Now retired, I moved from business management and operation in the 80's to work in community and government organisations, predominantly community services management and development, across aged care, disability, community, volunteers etc. Best job = driving a forklift.

I was 'reborn' in 1976 when I first saw a disc (frisbee) floating through the air, was immediately hooked, and flying disc sports has been a major part of my life since. Travelling, organising, competing, friendships, fun, developing and growing, as a person, as a sport, as a community. Was a founding member of Australian Frisbee Association (now AFDA), represented Australia at 3 World Championships and was (way back) 3 x Australian Women's Champ.

Passions = inclusion, diversity, integrity, community.
