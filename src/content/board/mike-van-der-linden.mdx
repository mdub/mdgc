I'm married and have 2 teenage daughters. An engineer by training, I've spent most of my working life in corporate and operational management roles around the world. During Covid, I took a package and now have the time to get involved in all the things I never had time for in the past. I'm into volleyball, energy efficiency, gardening and currently house renovations … & lots of DG.

I first played disc golf in Houston with my family. Unfortunately, they weren't keen and have eye rolled at the thought of DG ever since. After returning to Australia during 2020, I discovered DG at Dinner Plain and then that Bald Hill was within 5kms of home. After catching the DG bug, I joined the MDGC Board in early 2022 and have predominantly focused on Social Day organisation, Course Development and Strategic Planning aspects.

I look forward to playing a part in the continued growth of disc golf in Melbourne
