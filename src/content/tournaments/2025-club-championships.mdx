Who wants to wear the crown? The Melbourne Disc Golf Club will host a Club Championship tournament this year, with a similar format to past years.

So, here are the basics. The event will be held on December 14th. We plan for five divisions: A, B, C, Women's, and Age 50+. The A, B, and C divisions will all be in line with the rating system we use for Social Days. The competition will be two rounds, a morning round and afternoon round at two different Melbourne area courses. Current plan is for the courses to be Bicentennial and Bald Hill, with final word to come later.

To qualify, players need to submit their best rated Social Day round from 2025. Your qualification will be based on your best Social Day round from any Social Day over the 2025 season. This is a change from the last two years, when we required your 3 best submissions from 3 different courses. The HIGHEST RATED score in each division will qualify.

We hold many Social Days at each course over the year, so this should provide ample opportunity for people to attend at least one prior to the end of season.

Registration is in 2 sections. First, provide your personal information and the division you wish to compete in. Second, provide us with your best rounds to date so far in 2025 (See "Finding and Submitting Your Best Rounds" section below if you need help finding your best rounds).

Register for the event here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IG\_0L0F3yi2j14TpqbWb4u4K7VcdQ3p6RT6L0onVhn4](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IG_0L0F3yi2j14TpqbWb4u4K7VcdQ3p6RT6L0onVhn4)

If, at some point during 2025, you better your earlier submitted round, just email us at [mdgcclubchamps@gmail.com](mailto:mdgcclubchamps@gmail.com) and we'll update it.

Once you register, you will be added to the list of names looking to qualify. We will send out periodic updates as to where our divisions stand.

See below for full event details.
