**Livingstone Primary School** has installed a 6-basket course within their school grounds.
They designed it mainly for use by school students, and consequently the holes are shorter than most other courses.

That doesn’t mean the course is devoid of interest or challenge.
With short holes and some tight hyzer/anhyzer lines, it's a great place for ace runs, to practice your short game, or to introduce friends and family to disc golf.

## Availability

The course is available to the public outside of school hours.
  - after 3:30pm on weekdays
  - all day on weekends and public holidays

## Features

- 6 holes

## Facilities

- toilets - at the nearby Whitehorse Sportlink on Hanover Road
- water - at the nearby school playground

## Getting there

### By car

- Parking is available along Barradine Crescent, Vermont South.

### By public transport

- **Tram** (route **75**)
- **Bus** (routes **732**, **736** and **742**) – then a short walk north along Hanover Road
