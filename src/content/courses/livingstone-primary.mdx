Livingstone Primary School has installed a 6-basket course within their school grounds.
They designed it mainly for use by school students, and consequently the holes are shorter than most other courses.

That doesn’t mean the course is devoid of interest or challenge.
With short holes and some tight hyzer/anhyzer lines, it's a great place for ace runs, to practice your short game, or to introduce friends and family to disc golf.

## Features

- 6 holes
- only available during outside of school hours
  - after 3.30pm on weekdays
