Melbourne Disc Golf's home ground is **Ruffey Lake Park**, a sprawling expanse of public parkland nestled in the heart of suburban Melbourne. The course is free to play and open to everyone.

## Course Information

- **Cost**: Free to play

## History

The first permanent layout was installed by Manningham City Council in 2012, featuring six baskets and tee signs. In early 2016, the Council added three more baskets, while the **Melbourne Disc Golf Club (MDGC)** contributed by installing tees for these additions and creating alternate tees, expanding the layout into a full 18-hole course.

Most recently, in 2023, the course underwent a significant upgrade, gaining **nine concrete tee pads** and **18 permanent baskets**, cementing Ruffey Lake Park as one of Melbourne's premier disc golf destinations.
