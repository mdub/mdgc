## What

Social Days are the mainstay of the MDGC calendar, where most new players get their first experience of organised events.
We split the year into two seasons (Feb-Jun and Jul-Nov), with 15 Social Days in each season.

We aim to make social days welcoming and friendly -- a great place for new players to come and learn the rules and
pick some tips from more experienced club members. We typically get 30–60 players at each one, ranging from beginners to professionals,
young (kids) to old (die-hards).

All social days are free for club members. Casual players are welcome too (free first time, $12 per round after that).

Please note that (due to demand) **pre-registration is required** for all Social Days.
Registration typically closes on the evening before the event.

## When and where

We alternate between Saturdays and Sundays, and rotate around three "zones":

- **West Melbourne** - 1st weekend of month
- **South East Melbourne** - 2nd weekend of month
- **North East Melbourne** - 3rd weekend of month

Check [MDGC events on Disc Golf Metrix](https://discgolfmetrix.com/?u=club_events&id=235) for the latest schedule and registration.


## What to expect

Social Days typically feature:

- **Casual rounds:** play at your own pace with friendly groups
- **Skill mixing:** players of different abilities paired together
- **Equipment available:** try different discs and get advice
- **Social atmosphere:** Meet the MDGC community over coffee or lunch

## Registration and scoring

We use Disc Golf Metrix for event management, registration, and scoring:

- **Register:** [View MDGC events on Disc Golf Metrix](https://discgolfmetrix.com/?u=club_events&id=235)
- **Club Profile:** [MDGC on Disc Golf Metrix](https://discgolfmetrix.com/club/235)
- **On the Day:** Use the Disc Golf Metrix mobile app to track scores

## Shop in person

We often have the <a href="/club/shop">MDGC Shop</a> at social days (in mobile form), so it's a great opportunity
to buy new discs.
