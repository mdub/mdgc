			Since our founding in 2008, MDGC has been managed by passionate volunteers who donate their time and expertise to support the growth of disc golf in Melbourne. As a non-profit organisation, we rely on dedicated community members to guide our club's direction, and are always looking for enthusiastic members to help with various club activities and initiatives.
