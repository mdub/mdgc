## Welcome

Founded in 2008, the Melbourne Disc Golf Club (MDGC) is a not-for-profit organisation with a simple goal - to create a local community of players and to spread awareness of this enjoyable, challenging and environmentally responsible sport.

Our membership ranges from 9 to 70 years old so whether you're young or old, super competitive or just want to have fun, there's a place for you in our club.
