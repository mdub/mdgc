You've tried disc golf and you're hooked! Now it's time to take your game to the next level. Here's how to become a regular player and improve your skills.

## Build your disc collection

Once you're past the beginner stage, it's time to invest in your own discs. Different discs are designed for different types of throws:

**Putters** - Short range, accurate throws and putting into the basket. Most players carry 2-3 putters.

**Mid-range discs** - Versatile discs for controlled shots up to 100m. Great for learning proper technique. Carry 3-4 mid-range discs.

**Fairway drivers** - Designed for longer, controlled drives up to 150m. Start with slower, understable drivers. Carry 2-3 fairway drivers.

**Distance drivers** - Maximum distance potential, but require good technique. Wait until you can consistently throw 100m+ before adding these to your bag.

**Starter tip**: Don't buy distance drivers too early! Focus on putters and mid-range discs to develop proper form.
