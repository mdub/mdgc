Ready to try disc golf? Great! It's easier than you think, and you don't need much to get started.

## The basic rules

**Starting a hole**
- Throw from behind the tee pad (the designated starting area)
- Your first throw on each hole is from the tee

**After your first throw**
- Take your next throw from where your disc landed
- You must throw from within 30cm of where your disc lies
- If your disc is in bounds, play it where it lies

**Completing a hole**
- The hole is complete when your disc comes to rest in the basket
- The chains help catch your disc - aim for those!
- Count all your throws to get your score for that hole

**Out of bounds**
- Some courses mark areas as out of bounds (water, roads, etc.)
- If your disc lands out of bounds, add one penalty stroke
- Continue play from a marked spot near where it went out

**Fairway etiquette**
- The player farthest from the basket throws first
- Don't throw if someone is in your line of flight
- Let faster groups play through

## Basic equipment

If you decide to bring your own gear, here's what you need:

**Essential**
- At least one disc (a "mid-range" disc is best for beginners)
- Comfortable walking shoes
- Water bottle

**Recommended**
- Small towel or cloth for cleaning your discs
- Sun protection (hat, sunscreen)
- Light snacks for longer rounds

**Don't bring**
- Regular frisbees won't work well for disc golf - the discs are different!

## What to expect

**Time commitment**
- 9 holes typically takes 45-60 minutes
- 18 holes typically takes 1.5-2.5 hours
- Play at your own pace

**Physical activity**
- Lots of walking (2-4km for 18 holes)
- Not strenuous, but wear comfortable shoes
- Suitable for most fitness levels

**The playing environment**
- Most courses are in parks or natural bushland
- You'll be outdoors in all weather
- Watch for uneven ground and natural obstacles

## Learning tips

**Start simple**
- Focus on accuracy over distance
- Short, controlled throws are better than wild distance attempts
- Learn to throw straight before trying fancy shots

**Learn from others**
- Watch experienced players
- Ask questions - disc golfers love helping newcomers
- Don't be embarrassed about being a beginner

**Be patient**
- Your first round won't be perfect (nobody's is!)
- Focus on having fun, not on scores
- The sport has a learning curve, but it's enjoyable at every level

**Common beginner mistakes**
- Throwing too hard (control matters more than power)
- Using the wrong disc (start with a mid-range)
- Getting frustrated (remember, it's just a game!)
