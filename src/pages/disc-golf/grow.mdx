Okay, so you've [tried](/disc-golf/try) disc golf, and you're hooked. What now?

## Build your disc collection

It's time to invest in your own discs ... and perhaps a bag to put them in.

Different discs are designed for different types of throws:

- **Putters** - short range, accurate throws and putting into the basket
- **Mid-ranges** - versatile discs for controlled shots up to 100m; great for learning proper technique
- **Fairway drivers** - designed for longer, controlled drives
- **Distance drivers** - maximum distance potential, but require good technique

Tips:
- Focus on putters and mid-ranges to develop proper form.
- Try different discs, to get a feel for their different flight characteristics.
- Learn about disc "[stability](https://udisc.com/blog/post/disc-golf-terms-stability-flight-numbers)" and "[flight numbers](https://udisc.com/blog/post/disc-golf-disc-numbers-what-they-mean)"; favour "understable" discs to start with.
- Wait until you can consistently throw a fairway driver 100m+ before adding distance drivers to your bag.

The [MDGC Shop](/club/shop) is a great place to buy discs (and other gear).
Or, [search the web](https://www.google.com/search?q=disc+golf+discs+australia) to find other online stores.

## Play regularly

The more you play, the better you'll get.

- **Practice rounds** - Play casual rounds at [local courses](/courses); it's a great way to relax on the weekend, or after work.
- **Social days** - Join some of our [regular social events](/events/social); you'll learn faster (and probably have more fun) playing with others.
