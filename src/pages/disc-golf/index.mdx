Disc golf is similar to traditional golf: the goal is to get from a **tee** to a **target** in as few **throws** as possible. But instead of hitting balls with clubs, you throw flying discs with your hands.

## Golf vs disc golf

|  | traditional "ball" golf | disc golf |
|---|---|---|
| **thing** | small white **ball** | flying **disc** |
| **target** | **hole** in ground | metal **basket** on a pole |
| **tools** | metal **clubs** | your bare **hands** |
| **venue** | manicured **golf course** | public **park** |
| **cost** | $$$ (clubs + green fees) | $ (just buy discs) |
| **duration** | 4-5 hours | 2-3 hours |

Despite the differences above, there are _many_ similarities between the games; courses typically have 9 or 18 holes,
and we use golf terminology like _par_, _birdie_, _driver_, and _putter_.

## History

[Disc golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf) dates back to the early 1960s.
The first formal disc golf course was installed in Oak Grove Park, California in 1975, and the
Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) was formed in 1976.

The sport has grown exponentially since then, and saw major growth during the COVID pandemic.
There are now over 15,000 courses worldwide. Australia got its first permanent course in the 1990s,
and Melbourne now has many excellent [courses](../courses) across the metropolitan area.

## Why people love it

- **low barrier to entry** - no expensive equipment or memberships
- **accessible** - courses are often in public parks
- **casual atmosphere** - no dress codes, family-friendly

## Just don't say "frisbee"

A word of warning: don't call it "frisbee golf", unless you want a well-meaning pedant to (politely) correct you.
We tend not to use that term today, because:

  - "Frisbee®" is a trademark (of Wham-O Inc.)
  - most disc golf discs are made by _other_ companies

Best just call it "disc golf".
