# What is Disc Golf?

Disc golf is similar to traditional ball golf, with key differences:

## Basic Concept
- Players throw a disc (like a frisbee) instead of hitting a ball
- The goal is to complete each "hole" in as few throws as possible
- Each hole has a starting point (tee) and a target (metal basket)
- Hole lengths can range from 40m to over 300m

## Objective
The fundamental objective is to get the disc into the basket using the least number of throws, mirroring the scoring concept in ball golf. Players start at a designated tee area and aim to land their disc in a metal basket that serves as the "hole" target.
