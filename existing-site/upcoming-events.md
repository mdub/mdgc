## Content Summary

### Social Days Structure
- Regular social days throughout most of the year
- Open to new players of all ages and abilities
- **Important:** Pre-registration is required for social days, due to demand

### Three Regional Rotations
Social days operate on a monthly rotation across three Melbourne regions:

1. **West** – 1st weekend of the month
2. **South East** – 2nd weekend of the month  
3. **North East** – 3rd weekend of the month

### Schedule Format
- Each regional location alternates between Saturday and Sunday
- Creates a friendly, nurturing environment for players to meet and develop skills

### Key Messaging
- Emphasizes welcoming new players of all ages and abilities
- Highlights the supportive community aspect
- Stresses the importance of pre-registration due to demand

## Calendar System

### Modern Events Calendar (MEC)
- The original site uses a Modern Events Calendar WordPress plugin
- Events are managed through this system rather than direct Google Calendar integration
- Displays social days schedule in calendar format

### Google Calendar Integration
- **iCal Feed:** The site provides a Google Calendar iCal feed link
- **URL:** `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/bdc29ccf8e5f2030e5e1cd2f442658c335a497f504a8e01db6a1b8ea5d43e7de%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`
- **Purpose:** Allows users to subscribe to MDGC events in their personal calendars
- **Format:** Standard .ics calendar subscription
- **Implementation:** Can be used directly in the new site for calendar integration

### Event Calendar Details
- **Calendar Type:** Modern Events Calendar WordPress plugin
- **Display Format:** Month/week view showing social days rotation
- **Registration:** Pre-registration system integrated with calendar events
- **Schedule Pattern:** Predictable monthly rotation across three regions

## Implementation Notes

This content should be integrated into:
- `/events/social` page - detailed social days information including regional rotation
- `/events/index` page - overview of the three-region rotation system
- Consider adding pre-registration information and requirements
- **Calendar Integration:** Consider adding a simple calendar view or schedule display for the new site

### Key Features to Replicate:
1. Clear regional rotation schedule (West/South East/North East)
2. Weekend alternating pattern (Saturday/Sunday)
3. Pre-registration emphasis
4. Calendar or schedule view for upcoming social days

The regional rotation system (West/South East/North East) is a key organizational structure that should be reflected in the new site's social days content.
