# issue-032: Link to "DG in Melbourne" chat on Messenger 🔲

Add a link to the "DG in Melbourne" Facebook Messenger group chat on the website.

## Design

This should probably be added to the social/community section of the site, potentially:
- On the events page (as a way to stay connected with the community)
- On the club contact page (as another way to get in touch)
- In a "Community" or "Social" section

## Acceptance criteria

- Link to the "DG in Melbourne" Messenger chat is visible and accessible
- Link is placed in an appropriate location in the site structure
- Link opens the Messenger chat (may require users to be logged into Facebook/Messenger)

## Notes

Need to determine:
- The actual Messenger group chat URL/link
- Best location on the site for this link
- Whether to add it alongside other social media links or as part of community/events content
