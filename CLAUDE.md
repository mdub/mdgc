# Melbourne Disc Golf Club Website Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building a new modern website for the Melbourne Disc Golf Club (MDGC) using Astro and Tailwind CSS to replace their existing WordPress site.

## Site Architecture Evolution
The new site structure has diverged significantly from the original WordPress site to provide better information architecture and user experience:

### Original Site Structure (WordPress)
- Home, About (dropdown), Courses (dropdown), Events, Media (dropdown), Shop

### New Site Structure (Redesigned)
- **Disc Golf** (dropdown): Educational content about the sport
- **Courses** (dropdown): Location-based course information  
- **Club** (dropdown): MDGC-specific community content
- **Events**: Social days and tournaments
- **Shop**: Equipment and merchandise

This reorganization separates educational content from club operations and gives proper prominence to courses and events.

## Existing Site Analysis
- **Current Site**: https://www.melbournediscgolf.com/
- **Documentation**: See `existing-site/` directory for structured content mapping (reference only)
- **Note**: New site structure intentionally diverges from original for improved UX

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Astro 5.12.8
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.11
- **Deployment**: Static site generation

## Development Commands
- **Start dev server**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:4321)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Preview**: `npm run preview`

## Site Features
- Responsive design with mobile navigation
- Modern green color scheme reflecting disc golf/outdoor theme
- Reorganized navigation structure with improved information architecture
- Hero sections on all pages
- Card-based layouts for courses and events
- Accessible markup and semantic HTML
- Component-based architecture for reusable elements

## Implementation Status
- ✅ **Navigation Structure**: Complete redesign with new information architecture
- ✅ **Homepage**: Hero section and welcome content migrated
- ✅ **Disc Golf Section**: Educational content (What is Disc Golf, New Player Essentials)
- ✅ **Courses Section**: Melbourne courses + placeholder pages for Victoria/Australia
- ✅ **Club Section**: About MDGC, membership, contact, board member profiles
- ✅ **Events Section**: Social days structure and competitive opportunities
- ✅ **Shop Section**: Basic placeholder page created
- 🔄 **Content Population**: Many pages need additional content from original site
- ❌ **Media/Blog**: Not yet implemented (may be added to Club section)

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **URL Structure**: Moved from flat structure to organized subdirectories (`/club/`, `/courses/`, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Simplified from complex nested dropdowns to clearer categorical organization
- **Content Separation**: Distinguishes between educational disc golf content and club-specific information
- **Component Reuse**: BoardMember and Course components for consistent presentation
