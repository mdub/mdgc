## Existing site

The existing (Wordpress-based) website is hosted at https://www.melbournediscgolf.com/.

The [`existing-site/`](existing-site/) directory contains a "sketch" of that existing site, including key content.

## Approach

- Use a static site, for runtime simplicity and performance.
- Design should be responsive, mobile-first.
- Use clean, accessible, semantic HTML.
- Make it as easy as possible for non-technical club members to manage content.
  - use Astro components and/or "content collections" for consistency

## Writing style

- In headings, use sentence case, not title case.
  - e.g. "What you get" rather than "What You Get"

## Tech stack

- manage website source in Git (on GitHub)
- use [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a static site generator
- use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- deploy to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- use Decap CMS to manage content of some pages (courses, events)

## Site structure

We have structured the new site into these sections:

- **Disc Golf**: information about the sport of disc golf
- **Club**: information about the club, and how it operates
- **Courses**: information on where to play, in Melbourne
- **Events**: information about when to play with others - social days and tournaments
- **Shop**: buying discs etc (link to external shop site)

## Working on this project

Dear agent: when working with humans on this project, please:

- Explain the changes you make: why you decided to do them, and how they work.
- Don't commit changes to Git without checking first.
